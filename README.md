<br>This repo has been created with only me in mind, and will be a continuous WIP (work in progress) and there will be content that may not be relevant to course material (for a programme I am currently in) - please take note of that.<br>
<br>Peruse at your leisure 
<br>(= ANY feedback is welcome =)

<br>I just realised the hello-world repo I have in this account was made and last updated seven (7) years ago, hah! I will not be changing that and will leave it as it is. 
This message is to let you know, reader, that the the information contained in this repo - are from my head, the heads of people I have connected with, and from online sources - I do and will do my best to provide references where I can, albeit not in a formal manner or format (like APA and so on).
<br>There will also be things that don't make sense or are structured weirdly - I intend to, at some stage, go through and proofread things and organise them in a 'better' way as I reiterate through concepts covered. Again, this is a WIP and note that it isn't meant for some assessment for any academic institution.
<br>If you choose to share the content that is in here, or clone the entire repo - a little thank you or message can go a long way :) 
<br>The content that is here, 99% of the time, would have been typed by my hands as opposed to the control c'ing and p'ing of things - I find this helps absorbing whatever I'm covering. 
<br>
<br>Whatever you're doing, enjoy it. Ciao!
