Tux! :) 
*Commands currently are in the Commands Page - may be revised when I go through all this material later...*

- SSH is normally used to connect to a remote Linux box's Terminal
- Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol/connection between two devices in an encrypted form
- 

- who
	- print information about users who are currently logged in 
	- -a 
- uname -a
	- printing out Linux system version
- ps aux
	- shows running processes on the machine dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
- PATH:
	  - In Shell:
		  "echo $PATH"
- Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard

- $SHELL
	- /bin/zsh 
		- will change to the zsh shell if you have it in /bin/
	- $SHELL --version 
		- will display what shell you are running and it's details
- Permissions
	- Users
		- Root
			- UID = 0 (if a User does not have a UID of 0, then that User is not root)
				- uid -u *username*
		- id
		- 
	- Groups

- Directories
	- Common
		- /etc
			- Commonplace to store system files that are used by the OS
		- /var
			- Stores data that is frequently accessed or written by services or applications running on the system
				- Log Files (/var/log)
		- /root
			- Home for the root user
		- /tmp
			- Used to store data that is only needed to be accessed once or twice
			- Similar to RAM
				- once the system restarts or is shutdown, tmp is CLEARED :) 
		- ~/.config/ 
			- Location of installed packages that the related User has installed

- Python3's HTTP server on the fly
	- To be able to serve files
	- Called "HTTPServer" 
	- From which you would be able to use curl and/or wget commands from the receiving end to pull files from your machine/web_server
	- python3 -m http.server
		- Simply starts a on the fly web server (no need for Apache etc :) ) 

- Updog
	- Another webserver, more lightweight than Python3's variant above
	- https://github.com/sc0tfree/updog
	- Can set adhoc SSL certs and use basic auth over HTTP

- Backgrounding and Foregrounding Processes
	- **LOOK INTO THIS AND DETAIL FURTHER WITH SOME PRAC CUZ PLEB

- Automation
	- Task scheduling
		- Running commands
		- Backing up files
		- Launching programs
		- etc
	- cron
		- crontab
			- Started during boot
			- Responsible for facilitating and managing cron jobs
			- A file with formatting that is recognised by the cron process to execute each line ste-by-step (like a script :) ) 
			- crontabs require six specific values:
				- min - which minute to execute
				- hour - which hour to execute
				- dom - which day of the month
				- mon - which month
				- dow - day of the week
				- cmd - the actual command to run
			- use of the wildcard * is a thang, thing
			- crontabs can be modified by:
				- crontab -e
					- (using your default text editor)

- Package Management
	- When developers submit software to the community they submit it to an 'apt' repository
	- IF approved, that program will be released into the wild
	- Merits
		- User accessibilty
		- Open Source tools
	- /etc/apt
		- these files serve as the gateway/registry to the package manager/repos
	- You can also add your own community repos to your list
		- add-apt-respository
		- or by listing another provider
	- Managing Repositories
		- Package Management Software
			- apt
		- The integrity of what we download is guaranteed by the use of what is called GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) keys
			- A safety check from developers saying, "this is ours" 
			- If keys don't match up to what your system trust and what the devs used, then the software won't be downloaded

- System Logs
	- /var/log
	- rotating
		- OS automatically managing these logs
	- These logs normally will detail every single action or event that has taken place from a service that is running on the machine
	- access log
	- error log
