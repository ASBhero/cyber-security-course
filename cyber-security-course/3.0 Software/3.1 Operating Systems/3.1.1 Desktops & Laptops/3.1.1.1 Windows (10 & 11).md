		- (Or System Tray)
- File System
	- NTFS
		- New Technology File System 
		- Before NTFS
			- Fat16/Fat32 (File Allocation Table)
			- HPFS (High Performance File System)
			- FAT in use in USB devices, MicroSD cards etc
		- Known as a journaling file system
		- In thee event of a failure, the file system can automatically repair the folders/files on the disk using information stored in a log file
			- This functionality is not available on FAT file systems
		- Addresses many issues that the FAT filesystem had:
			- Supports files larger than 4GB
			- Set permissions for specific folders and/or files
			- Folder and file compression
			- Encryption (EFS or Encryption File System)
		- Permissions *( needing to describe the chmod function in Linux)*
			- Full Control
				- Folder / File = what do you think
			- Modify
				- Folder
					- Permits reading, writing, of files and subfolders, allows the deletion of the folder
				- File
					- Permits reading/writing of file, deletion of the file
			- Read & Execute
				- Folders
					- Viewing and listing of files and subfolders as well of executing of files (inherited by files and folders)
				- Files
					- Viewing and accessing of a files contents, executing of a file
			- List Folder Contents
				- Folders
					- Viewing and listing of files and subfolders as well as executing of files, inhered by folders only
				- Files
					- Bruh
			- Read
				- Folders
					- Viewing and listing of files and subfolders
				- Files
					- Permits viewing or accessing of the files contents
			- Write
				- Folders
					- Permits adding of files and subfolders
				- Files
					- Permits writing to a file
		- **ADS**
			- Alternate Data Streams
			- File attribute specific to NTFS
			- Every file has at lease one data stream ($DATA) 
				- The contents of a .txt file
				- Executable code in a .exe file
				- Also referred to as the "unnamed data stream"
			- ADS allows files to contain more than one stream of data
			- Natively, WinExplorer doesn't display ADS to the User
			- There are third party exe's that can be used to view this data
			- Powershell gives you the ability to view ADS for files
			- An ADS must be named
				- Note that $DATA for the file will remain unchanged if there are ADS's added
			- Add a colon at the end of the file name and extension along with the name of the ADS
				- example: test.txt:stream2
			- MACs make use of two streams per file
				- One for data
				- One for resource information
			- Since NTFS supports multiple streams, a MAC file could be copied on to a Windows Server and back again without losing the resource stream
			- Archive Management and Backup Software use ADS to store file revision information
			- Web Browsers add a stream to files downloaded from the Internet that includes security information about where the file came from
			- Adversaries can misuse ADS for malicious purposes such as malware attacks
				- Similar to a unknown compartment in a suitcase used by a smuggler to smuggle something across borders or by inspection officers
			- ADS can be used to hide code and execute future attacks while skirting basic sec utility detection 
			- ADS can store any type of file, audio, video, images, code
			- ADS are hidden, users wouldn't be able to detect them when using directory indexing or listing commands
			- Tools to gain visibility of ADS
				- Echo and More
				- Sysinternals Streams utility
				- /R option of dir in command-line
				- PowerShell 3.0
					- has six cmdlets to directly manipulate content for ADS
- Windows and System32 Folders
	- C: > Windows
		- Doesn't have to sit in the C: drive 
		- Can reside in any other drive and also in a different folder
		- Where the environment variables are held
			- System env variables
			- %windir%
	- System32
		- Important files that are critical for the OS
- User Accounts / Profiles / Permissions
	- Users:
		- Administrator
			- Add/Del users
			- Modify groups, system settings
			- Admin stuff
		- Standard
			- Not able to perform system-level changes
				- Ie install programs :) 
	- Profiles
		- Each user has their own "Profile" on the system
		- C:>Users
		- Profile is created upon initial login
	- Local User and Group Management
		- lusrmgr.msc
- UAC - User Account Control
	- Make sure you aren't stupid and disable the local default administrator account
	- AFTER you create an additional, different named, local admin account ;) 
	- Then, your main account, ensure it isn't in the Administrators Group
	- Simple, and basic. Do it if you're reading this and haven't done so already
	- Same goes for your Linux builds, any builds. (You do not want the main account you'll be playing with/in to be an admin, period.)
	- :) 
	- User Access Control
		- Elevated permissions required to install applications or run system tasks/programs
- Control Panel
	- Please don't go away...
	- Ongoing changes being made to this what seems to be going to be extinct feature in Windows
	- Otherwise the "Control Panel" should speak for itself
	- The Search feature/function is real handy for finding things, not just here, but almost anywhere in Windows
- Task Manager
	- CTRL + SHIFT + ESC
	- Gives information on applications, processes that are running on the System
	- Also details around
		- CPU
		- RAM
		- Network
		- Graphics
		- A fair bit
		- have a look
