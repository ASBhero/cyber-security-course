The process of hiding or coding information so that only the person a message was intended for can read it. The art of cryptography has been used to code messages for thousands of years and continues to be used in bank cards, computer passwords, and ecommerce. (Fortinet)
*please take note that some of the content here will not be encryption - I'll place whatever those entries are in their own section at some stage .. Maybe :) 

- Plaintext
	- As it reads, just plain text. Not encrypted in any way 
- Ciphertext
	- Encrypted text transformed from plaintext using an encryption algorithm. (TechTarget)
- Symmetric
	- Use the same cryptographic keys for both the encryption of plaintext and the decryption of ciphertext (from Wikipedia)
- Asymmetric
	- Public-key cryptography (or asymmetric cryptography), is the field of cryptographic systems that use pairs of related keys. 
	- Each key pair consists of a public key and a corresponding private key. 
	- Key pairs are generated with cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems termed one-way functions. 
	- Security of public-key cryptography depends on keeping the private key secret - the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security. 
	- Anyone with a public key can encrypt a message, yielding a ciphertext. BUT only those who know the corresponding private key can decrypt the ciphertext to obtain the original message.

- Hash
	- Takes plaintext and converts it into a hash (encrypted)
	- They are not reversible
		- "You can make hash out of a potato, but you can't make hash back into a potato" (lol good one Teacher)
	- Most popular uses:
		- File Identification
		- Storing sensitive data (like passwords)
			- When you create a password on a website, your password is converted to hash and stored in the websystem's database
			- If you use the same password when logging in again, the website will convert it to hash, and compare it with the hash in the database. 
				- If they match, you're in love, and you're connected
- MD5 (Message Digest Version 5) - https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/
	- Cryptographic hash algorithm used to generate a 128-bit digest from a string of any length
	- Remember that HASH is one-way encryption, you can't reverse it.
		- Kris's analogy:
			- You can make hash out of a potato, but you turn hash back into a potato (lel)
	- Made by Ron Rivest in 1991
	- MD5 Checksums say for example, can verify the integrity of files received on the receiving end of a connection
	- That's how the word "hello" looks as MD5 hash 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592
	- Also used to ensure the data integrity of files. Because MD5 always produces the same output for the same given input, it can be used to compare a hash of the source file with a newly created hash of the destination file to check that it is intact and unmodified.
		- Real useful for data integrity when transferring data (such as in TCP/IP)
- SHA1
- SHA256
- SHA512
- Encoding - https://www.base64decode.org/
	- Encoded data can be decoded immediately, without keys. 
	- It is not a form of encryption, it's just a way of representing data
	- Popular encoding base is Base64. 
	- Here's what "hi there" looks with Base64 encoding: **aGkgdGhlcmU=**

- DNSCrypt
	- *expand on this*
- Nonce (Number Used Once)
- ZRTP
	- Cryptographic key-agreement protocol to negotiate the keys for encryption between two end points in a Voice over IP telephony call based on the RTP (Real-time Transfer Protocol). It uses the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol for encryption. (Wikipedia)
- Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
	- the goal of this is to securely establish a channel to create and share a key for symmetric key algorithms. 
	- Generally it's used for encryption, password-authenticated key agreement and forward security. 
	- Password-authenticated key agreements are used to prevent MitM (man in the middle) attacks!
- Shor's Algorithm
	- A quantum algorithm for finding the prime factors of an integer. It was developed in 1994 by Peter Shor. 
- Caesar Cipher
	- Used by Julius Caesar around 58 BC
	- Substitution cipher that shifts letters in a message to make it unreadable if intercepted
	- To decrypt, the receiver reverses the shift
	- Arab mathematician, Al-Kindi, broke the Caesar Cipher using frequency analysis, which exploits patterns in letter frequencies
- ASCII
  American Standard Code for Information Interchange
	- A 7-bit encoding standard which represents text using integers 0-127
	- Hexadecimal can be used to represent an ASCII string
	- Used for electronic communication and in programming languages such as HTML. 
- Base64
	- An encoding scheme
	- Represents binary data as ASCII string using an alphabet of 64 chars. 
	- One character in a Base64 string will encode 6 bits (4 characters would equal 24bits, thus three Bytes)
	- Base64 when used online allows for binary data like images to be included into CSS or HTML files
- RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
	- basis of a cryptosystem
	- Used for specific security services or purposes
	- Enables public key encryption and is widely used to secure sensitive data when being sent over an unsecure network
	- RSA works on numbers, although message are made up of characters/string
	- One would need to consider how to convert an RSA message into numbers so that that mathematical calculations can be performed
- Unicode
  Universal Character Set
	- Standard by the Industry for encoding and representing characters in computers
- XOR
	- bitwise operator which returns 0 if the bits are identical, and a 1 if not. Mainly identified by the ^ character
		- 0 0 = 0 
		- 0 1 = 1
	- xor() properties
		- to undo a chain of operations that have encrypted a file
		- Essentially comparing keys to one another
		- Four main properties
			- Commutative:
				- The order of order of XOR operations is not important
				- A ^ B = B ^ A
			- Associative:
				- A chain of operations can be carried out without order (we don't need to fuss about brackets)
				- A ^ (B ^ C) = (A ^ B) ^ C
			- Identity:
				- The identity is 0, so XOR with 0 won't do anything
				- A ^ 0 = 0 
			- Self-Inverse:
				- Something XOR'd with itself results in 0
				- A ^ A = 0
- Cryptography Salts
	- Made up of random bits added to each password instance before its hashing
	- Salts create unique passwords even in the instance of two users choosing the same password
	- Help mitigate hash table attacks by forcing attacks to re-compute them using the salts for each user
	- Extra bit of randomness that is stored in the DB containing the hashed password (salt)
	- Added after the password has been supplied (ie pass123, then the salt is applied after to create the hash and is stored in the DB)
- Pepper
	- A pepper is a secret added to an input such as a password during hashing with a cryptographic hash function. 
	- This value differs from a salt in that it is not stored alongside a password hash, but rather the pepper is kept separate in some other medium, such as a Hardware Security Module. 
- Steganography
	- Practice of concealing information within another message or physical object to avoid detection. 
	- Can be used to hide virtually any type of digital content, including text, image video or audio content. 
	- The hidden data is then extracted at its destination
