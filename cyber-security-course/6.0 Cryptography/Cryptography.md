The process of hiding or coding information so that only the person a message was intended for can read it. The art of cryptography has been used to code messages for thousands of years and continues to be used in bank cards, computer passwords, and ecommerce. (Fortinet)

- Plaintext
	- As it reads, just plain text. Not encrypted in any way 
- Ciphertext
	- Encrypted text transformed from plaintext using an encryption algorithm. (TechTarget)
- Symmetric
	- Use the same cryptographic keys for both the encryption of plaintext and the decryption of ciphertext (from Wikipedia)
- Asymmetric
	- Public-key cryptography (or asymmetric cryptography), is the field of cryptographic systems that use pairs of related keys. 
	- Each key pair consists of a public key and a corresponding private key. 
	- Key pairs are generated with cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems termed one-way functions. 
	- Security of public-key cryptography depends on keeping the private key secret - the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security. 
	- Anyone with a public key can encrypt a message, yielding a ciphertext. BUT only those who know the corresponding private key can decrypt the ciphertext to obtain the original message.

- Hash
	- Takes plaintext and converts it into a hash (encrypted)
	- They are not reversible
		- "You can make hash out of a potato, but you can't make hash back into a potato" (lol good one Teacher)
	- Most popular uses:
		- File Identification
		- Storing sensitive data (like passwords)
			- When you create a password on a website, your password is converted to hash and stored in the websystem's database
			- If you use the same password when logging in again, the website will convert it to hash, and compare it with the hash in the database. 
				- If they match, you're in love, and you're connected
- MD5 (Message Digest Version 5) - https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/
	- Cryptographic hash algorithm used to generate a 128-bit digest from a string of any length
	- Remember that HASH is one-way encryption, you can't reverse it.
		- Kris's analogy:
			- You can make hash out of a potato, but you turn hash back into a potato (lel)
	- Made by Ron Rivest in 1991
	- MD5 Checksums say for example, can verify the integrity of files received on the receiving end of a connection
	- That's how the word "hello" looks as MD5 hash 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592
	- Also used to ensure the data integrity of files. Because MD5 always produces the same output for the same given input, it can be used to compare a hash of the source file with a newly created hash of the destination file to check that it is intact and unmodified.
		- Real useful for data integrity when transferring data (such as in TCP/IP)
- Encoding - https://www.base64decode.org/
	- Encoded data can be decoded immediately, without keys. 
	- It is not a form of encryption, it's just a way of representing data
	- Popular encoding base is Base64. 
	- Here's what "hi there" looks with Base64 encoding: **aGkgdGhlcmU=**

- DNSCrypt
	- *expand on this*
- Nonce (Number Used Once)
- ZRTP
	- Cryptographic key-agreement protocol to negotiate the keys for encryption between two end points in a Voice over IP telephony call based on the RTP (Real-time Transfer Protocol). It uses the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol for encryption. (Wikipedia)
- Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
	- the goal of this is to securely establish a channel to create and share a key for symmetric key algorithms. 
	- Generally it's used for encryption, password-authenticated key agreement and forward security. 
	- Password-authenticated key agreements are used to prevent MitM (man in the middle) attacks!
- Shor's Algorithm
	- A quantum algorithm for finding the prime factors of an integer. It was developed in 1994 by Peter Shor.
