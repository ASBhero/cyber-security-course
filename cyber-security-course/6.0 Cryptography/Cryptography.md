The process of hiding or coding information so that only the person a message was intended for can read it. The art of cryptography has been used to code messages for thousands of years and continues to be used in bank cards, computer passwords, and ecommerce. (Fortinet)

- MD5 (Message Digest Version 5)
	- Cryptographic hash algorithm used to generate a 128-bit digest from a string of any length
	- Remember that HASH is one-way encryption, you can't reverse it.
		- Kris's analogy:
			- You can make hash out of a potato, but you turn hash back into a potato (lel)
	- Made by Ron Rivest in 1991
	- MD5 Checksums say for example, can verify the integrity of files received on the receiving end of a connection
