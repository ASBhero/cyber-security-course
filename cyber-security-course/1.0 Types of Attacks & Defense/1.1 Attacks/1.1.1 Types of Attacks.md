(the above was taken from crowdstrike.com as the 12 most common types of attacks today June 2024)

- PHISHING
	- An attempt to steal sensitive information, typically in the form of usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, bank account information or other important data in order to utilise or sell the stolen information
- MITM - Man-In-The-Middle
- RCE - Remote Code Execution
- Passive Reconnaissance
	- Gathering information about a company
	- To gain a better understanding of how a network structure (or system in general) is designed/set up. 
- Spoofing
	- 
- 
- SQL Injection Attack
	- A common attack vector that uses malicious SQL code for backend database manipulation to access information that was not intended to be displayed. 
- HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS)

- Fork Bomb
	- Also known as a Rabbit Virus)
	- Self-replicating child processes consume system resources, blocking legitimate programs from running and preventing the creation of new processes. During an attack, keyboard inputs (log out attempts for example) are ignored, essentially locking the system
- Zip Bomb
	- Also known as Decompression Bomb or Zip of Death (ZOD)
	- A malicious archive file designed to crash or render useless the program or system reading it. Often employed to disable antivirus software, in order to create an opening for more traditional malware.
	- Instead of hijacking the program's operation, creates an archive that requires an excessive amount of time, disk space or memory to unpack. 
	- Most modern AV utilities can detect a ZIP Bomb before unpacking it. 
	- The “42. zip” is one of the largest and best-known zip bombs. When unopened, it appears to hold only 42 kilobytes of data. However, after decompressing, the file can expand to 4.5 petabytes (the equivalent of 4,500 terabytes). (taken from us.norton.com)
- XML Bomb
	- A form of DOS/DDOS attack where a small piece of code is sent to overwhelm the program that parses XML files and crash the server. 
	- When an XML parser tries to process the message, nested data entities inside of it start growing exponentially and crash the server. 
	- A BILLION Laughs (lol)
- Growth Hacking
	- **RESEARCH THIS**
- XSS - Cross-Site Scripting
	- Stored XSS exploits occur when an attacker injects dangerous content into a data store that is later read and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. 
- Supply Chain Attack
	- A cyberattack that targets a trusted third-party vendor who offers services or software vital to the supply chain. 
	- Software Supply Chain Attacks inject malicious code into an application in order to infect all users of an app, while hardware supply chain attacks compromise physical components for the same purpose. 
	- Software supply chains are particularly vulnerable because modern software is not written from scratch: rather, it involves many off-the-shelf components, such as third-party APIs, open source code and proprietary code from software vendors. 
	- Today the average software project has **203 dependencies**.
