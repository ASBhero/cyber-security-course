*not logs from trees... SO bad.*

- Records of events within a system
	- User logins
	- File accesses
	- System errors
	- Network connections
	- Changes to data and or system configs
- Details:
	- Timestamp of the event
	- Name of the system or application that generated the log entry 
	- The type of event that occurred
	- Additional details (IP addresses, Usernames who initiated events etc)
- The W's
	- What happened?
	- When did it happen?
	- Where did it happen?
	- Who is responsible?
	- Were there actions successful?
	- What was the result of the action?

- Common Log Types
	- Application Logs
	- Audit Logs
		- Related to operational procedures crucial for regulatory compliance
	- Security Logs
		- Logins, perm changes, firewall activity, file access, etc
	- Server Logs
		- System, event, error and access logs, Server-side related events
	- System Logs
		- Kernel activities, system errors, boot sequences, hardware states, etc
	- Network Logs
		- Traffic, connections, Network-related events
	- Database Logs
		- Activities within a database system, queries, updates, etc
	- Web Server Logs
		- Requests processed by a Web Server, URLs, response codes etc

- Log Formats
	- Semi-structured
		- Syslog Message Format
		- Windows Event Log (EVTX) Format
	- Structured
		- Field Delimited Formats
			- CSVs and TSVs (tab separated values)
		- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
		- W3C Extended Log Foramt (ELF)
			- Web Server logging
			- IIS Servers use this
		- eXtensible Markup Language
	- Unstructured
		- NCSA Common Log Format (CLF)
			- Web Server log format for Client requests
			- Used by Apache
		- NCSA Combined Log Format (Combined)
			- Adding fields like Referrer and User Agent
			- Used by Nginx by default
- Log Standards
	- A set of guidelines or specs that define how logs should be created, transmitted and kept
	- Common Event Expression (CEE)
		- Developed by MITRE
		- Common structure for log data
		- Making it easier to create, transmit, store and analyse logs
	- OWASP Logging Cheat Sheet
		- A guide for devs on building application logging mechanisms, in mainly focusing on security logging
	- Syslog Protocol
		- Standard for message logging, allowing the separation of the software that generates messages from the system that stores them and the software that reports and analyses them
	- NIST Special Publication 800-82
		- Guides computer security log management
	- Azure Monitor Logs
		- Log monitoring on Azure guidelines
	- Google Cloud Logging
		- Guidelines for logging on the GCP - Google Cloud Platform
	- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging
		- Guidelines for logging on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
	- Virginia Tech - Standard for Information Technology Logging
		- Sample log review and compliance guideline

- Log Collection
	- Essential in log analysis
	- Involves the aggregation of logs from diverse sources such as Servers, Network Devices, Software, and Databases
	- NTP - Network Time Protocol is crucial in maintaining the system's time accuracy when generating logs
	- To ensure the integrity of the timeline of stored event(s), logs
	- Having a comprehensive data set to review, steps in being able to do so:
		- Identify sources
			- All potential log sources of an "event"
				- From all servers, databases, applications, devices involved
			- Choose a Log Collector
				- Choose a suitable log collector tool, or software that aligns with the infrastructure of the system
			- Configure Collection Parameters
				- Ensure that time-sync is enabled through NTP to maintain accurate timelines
				- Adjust settings to determine which events to log at what intervals and prioritise based on importance
			- Test Collection
				- Once configured, run a test to ensure logs are appropriately collected from all sources involved

- Log Management
	- Secure storage
	- Organised systematically 
	- Ready for swift/efficient access
	- Steps:
		- Storage
			- Retention period
			- Accessibility
		- Organisation
			- Classify logs based on their source, type or other criteria for easy access later
		- Backup
			- Regularly back up your logs to prevent data loss
		- Review
			- Periodically review logs to ensure they are stored and categorised correctly

- Log Centralisation
	- Important for 
		- Efficient log access
		- In-depth Analyssis
		- Rapid incident response
	- Real-time detection
	- Automatic notifications
	- Seamless integration
	- Incident management systems
	- Can consider the following:
		- Choose a Centralised System
			- Elastic Stack
			- Splunk
		- Integrate Sources
			- Connect all log sources into one centralised system
		- Set up Monitoring
			- Utilise tools that provide real-time monitoring and alerts for specific events
		- Integration with Incident Management
			- Ensure that the centralised system can integrate seamlessly with any incident management tools or protocols the infrastructure has in place
