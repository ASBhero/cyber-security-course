Identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities on a Client's system and/or network.

- Developing a Risk Matrix
- Identifying Risk Ratings
- Improving the Client's security posture
- These assessments assist the Client in prioritising and implementing appropriate security measures to mitigate and minimise cyber security risks
- Assists in assuring confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Client's information systems.

0. Define the Client's Risk Position
1. Define the context
	- Identify assets that need to be protected
		- Sensitive information
		- Customer data
		- Financial information
		- Critical assets important to the client
2. Define the Risk Matrix
	- Define the likelihood, consequence and risk rating for each potential risk scenario
		- Risk Rating - multiplying the likelihood and consequence of a risk
3. Define Risk Scenarios
	- Identify the specific risks that the Client is trying to protect their assets from
	- Examples:
		- A cyberattack
		- A natural disaster
		- Employee negligence
4. Assess risk rating for each scenario
	- Calculate the inherent risk rating for each risk scenario
	- Assuming initially that there are *no* measures set in place to reduce the risk
5. Assess risk rating for each scenario with the *current* measures that are set in place
6. Assess risk levels for each scenario with *additional* measures set in place and define their ratings
7. Create a Risk Assessment Report for the client which will summarise the findings above, the risk mitigation strategy, and any recommended measures that can be set in place for implementation
