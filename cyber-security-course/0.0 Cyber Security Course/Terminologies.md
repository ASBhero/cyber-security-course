- LoRA - Low-Rank Adaptation || Learned Rank Augmentation || A wireless modulation technique
	- Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is **a technique designed to refine and optimise large language models**. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods that require extensive retraining of the entire model, LoRA focuses on adapting only specific parts of the neural network.22 Jan 2024 (from deeperinsights.com/ai-blog)
	- A LoRA (short for Learned Rank Augmentation) model is **a small model that is applied on top of a standard image generation model like Stable Diffusion**. It allows for fine-tuning of the base model without having to retrain the whole model from scratch, which can be very time-consuming and resource-intensive. (from a reddit board)
	- LoRa is a wireless modulation technique derived from **Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS)** technology. It encodes information on radio waves using chirp pulses - similar to the way dolphins and bats communicate! LoRa modulated transmission is robust against disturbances and can be received across great distances.
