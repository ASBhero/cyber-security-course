- LoRA - Low-Rank Adaptation || Learned Rank Augmentation || A wireless modulation technique
	- Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is **a technique designed to refine and optimise large language models**. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods that require extensive retraining of the entire model, LoRA focuses on adapting only specific parts of the neural network.22 Jan 2024 (from deeperinsights.com/ai-blog)
	- A LoRA (short for Learned Rank Augmentation) model is **a small model that is applied on top of a standard image generation model like Stable Diffusion**. It allows for fine-tuning of the base model without having to retrain the whole model from scratch, which can be very time-consuming and resource-intensive. (from a reddit board)
	- LoRa is a wireless modulation technique derived from **Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS)** technology. It encodes information on radio waves using chirp pulses - similar to the way dolphins and bats communicate! LoRa modulated transmission is robust against disturbances and can be received across great distances.

- Kernel
	- The very core of an OS. 
	- A type of low-level program that has its interfacing with the hardware on top of which all the applications run (disks, RAM, CPU, Video Adaptor(s) and so on)
- Mach
	- The name of the MacOS kernel
- Windows NT
	- Microsoft's kernel family (first created 27th July, 1993)
- Binary/Binaries
	- Bit - A binary digit and the smallest unit of data (comprised of either a 0 or a 1 - meaning a signal is involved or it isn't)
	- Byte - Comprises of eight (8) bits
	- Binaries
		- Compiled code that allow a program to be installed without having to compile the source code
		- Usually placed in one default/regular location in an OS's file system
			- Windows:
				- Windows>System32
			- Unix/Linux
				- root>bin
- Piping
	- In computer programming, especially in Unix OSes, a pipe is a technique for passing information from one program process or command to another. 
	  Unlike other forms of interprocess communication (IPC), ie the communication between related processes, a pipe refers to one-way communication only (techtarget.com)
	  - A pipe is a form of redirection (transfer of standard output to some other destination) that is used in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems to send the output of one command/program/porocess to another command/program /process for further processing. (geeksforgeeks.org)
  - IPC - Inter-Process Communciation
  - MULTICS - Multiplexed Information and Computing Service 
	  - A pioneering computer operating system developed in the 1960s and 1970s. Its influence on modern computing is noteworthy.
	  - Based on the concept of single-level memory
	  - Revolutionised file management and storage by introducing a hierarchical file structure. 
  - Sunsetting A Project
	  - Announcement Date -> Sunset Time -> Then the actual killing of the project
	  - Meaning that the announcement of killing/ending a project doesn't mean that it will necessarily end straight away, there is that 'sunset time'
  - Technical Debt
	  - In software development and other Information Technology fields, technical debt is the implied cost of future reworking required when choosing an easy but limited solution instead of a better approach that could take more time. (wikipedia)
