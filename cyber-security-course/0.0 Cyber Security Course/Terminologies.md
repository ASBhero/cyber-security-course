- LoRA - Low-Rank Adaptation || Learned Rank Augmentation || A wireless modulation technique
	- Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is **a technique designed to refine and optimise large language models**. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods that require extensive retraining of the entire model, LoRA focuses on adapting only specific parts of the neural network.22 Jan 2024 (from deeperinsights.com/ai-blog)
	- A LoRA (short for Learned Rank Augmentation) model is **a small model that is applied on top of a standard image generation model like Stable Diffusion**. It allows for fine-tuning of the base model without having to retrain the whole model from scratch, which can be very time-consuming and resource-intensive. (from a reddit board)
	- LoRa is a wireless modulation technique derived from **Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS)** technology. It encodes information on radio waves using chirp pulses - similar to the way dolphins and bats communicate! LoRa modulated transmission is robust against disturbances and can be received across great distances.

	- Byte - Comprises of eight (8) bits
	- Binaries
		- Compiled code that allow a program to be installed without having to compile the source code

- Piping
	- In computer programming, especially in Unix OSes, a pipe is a technique for passing information from one program process or command to another. 
	  Unlike other forms of interprocess communication (IPC), ie the communication between related processes, a pipe refers to one-way communication only (techtarget.com)
	  - A pipe is a form of redirection (transfer of standard output to some other destination) that is used in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems to send the output of one command/program/porocess to another command/program /process for further processing. (geeksforgeeks.org)
  - IPC - Inter-Process Communciation
  - MULTICS - Multiplexed Information and Computing Service 
	  - A pioneering computer operating system developed in the 1960s and 1970s. Its influence on modern computing is noteworthy.
	  - Based on the concept of single-level memory
	  - Revolutionised file management and storage by introducing a hierarchical file structure. 
  - Sunsetting A Project
	  - Announcement Date -> Sunset Time -> Then the actual killing of the project
	  - Meaning that the announcement of killing/ending a project doesn't mean that it will necessarily end straight away, there is that 'sunset time'
  - Technical Debt
	  - In software development and other Information Technology fields, technical debt is the implied cost of future reworking required when choosing an easy but limited solution instead of a better approach that could take more time. (wikipedia)
  - Blockchain (Append-only)
	  - Once data is written to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. Each block in the chain contains a record of transaction or data, and once a block is added to the chain, it becomes a permanent part of the ledger. (brainly.in)
  - I2P - The Invisible Internet Project
	  - An anonymous network layer that allows for censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer communication. Anonymous connections are achieved by encrypting the user's traffic, and sending it through a volunteer-run network of roughly 55,000 computers distributed around the world. 
  - init script - Initialisation Script (SysVinit)
	  - Scripts that run before the build script is executed. They allow you to customise the build environment or configure settings early in the build. 
  - systemd - the new init framework

Encryption/Cryptology Terms  
  - PT - Plaintext
  - CT - Ciphertext
  - K - Key
  - Symmetric key encryption
  - Asymmetric key encryption
  - PGP - Pretty Good Privacy
	  - Typically used for emails
  -  AES encryption - Advanced Encryption Standard (add this to the Crypto page)
  - Entropy
	- Entropy, in the context of cryptography, is **related to random number generation, and more precisely, it refers to the “amount of unpredictable randomness**” in a physical system. We call an entropy source the physical system that produces random signals. (Quside)
- 0-day, zero-day vulnerability
	- Special type of bug where people have not had any time to prepare any defense for
	- A zero-day is a vulnerability in software or hardware that is typically unknown to the vendor and for which no patch or other fix is available. The vendor has zero days to prepare a patch as the vulnerability has already been described or exploited. (Wikipedia)
