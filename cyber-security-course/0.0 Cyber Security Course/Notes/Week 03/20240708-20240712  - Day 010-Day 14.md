Topics: 
- - Steganography
	- Practice of concealing information within another message or physical object to avoid detection. 
	- Can be used to hide virtually any type of digital content, including text, image, video or audio content. 
	- The hidden data is then extracted at its destination
- Race condition 
	- Related to programming
	- Occur when two computer program processes, or threads, attempt to access the same resource at the same time and cause problems in the system. Common issue in multithreaded applications and concurrent programming.
- Threading 
	- Execution of the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler. 
	- It is a sequence of instructions given to the CPU by a program or application. 
- Netcat
	- A computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP. 
	- The command is designed to be a dependable back-end that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts.
- XIFF format
	- Exchangeable Image File
	- Standard that specifies formats for images, sound and ancillary tags used by digital cameras, scanners and other systems handling image and sound files recorded by digital cameras. 
- Email headers
	- A hidden snippet of code in an email that contains detailed information about the sender, the recipient and how the  message was routed and authenticated.
- MX records
	- Mail Exchange record
	- Identifies the mail servers being used by the Domain Namethat is in question
- SPF Records
	- Sender Policy Framework
	- Email authentication method which ensures the sending mail server is authorised to originate mail from the email sender's domain. 
	- This authentication only applies to the email sender listed in the "envelope from" field during the initial SMTP connectiion
- DMARC
	- Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance
	- Email security protocol
	- Verifies email senders by buildin gon the DNS, DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) and Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
- DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail)
	- The DKIM signature enables domain authentication to validate that the message was legitimately sent from the specified domain
- Email blocklists
- TCP / UDP
- Ports
- Modular Arithmetic 
	- A system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" when reaching a certain value, called the modulus. 
	- The modern approach was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (published in 1801)
- Hashing Checksums 
- Integrity Password
- Storage: bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2, PBKDF2 Salts
- Bcrypt
	- password-hashing function 
	- Based on the Blowfish cipher
- Scrypt
	- Scrypt is a password-based key derivation function
	- Specifically designed to make it costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks by requiring large amounts of memory
- Argon2
	- A key derivation function 
	- Password-hashing function that summarizes the state of the art in the design of memory-hard functions and can be used to hash passwords for credential storage, key derivation or other applications
- PBKDF2
	- Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)
	- Make it more difficult for an attacker to crack a password, even if they possess the hashed password value
- Cryptography Salts
	- Made up of random bits added to each password instance before its hashing
	- Salts create unique passwords even in the instance of two users choosing the same password
	- Help mitigate hash table attacks by forcing attackers to re-compute them using the salts for each user
