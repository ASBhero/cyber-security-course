(Please take note that these todo's are tailored for me personally and may not apply to you, reader.)

- GET THE TODO's SORTED FROM CLASSES! :) 
- Podman VMs and Docker (look into)
- MainDTRig = Fedora main
- WIN+SHIFT+C : gives you the colour hex tag! (note this and other random keyboard shortcuts somewhere - and also the usual ones)
- **Get back to training with Python** (WIP)
- **Go through each main subject and the content covered in teh notes and expand on them in respective sections of this vault**
- **Rationalise/rationalize/organise! each topic/content in this vault**
	- Create a brief intro to each page/section
- picoctf
	- Online CTF platform allowing for creative learning
-  MattKC Video on PS2 Savefile Recovery
- Bash scripting basics
- Find out if there is a difference from an email blocklist and an email blacklist
- Stacking Tandems
-Reputation and location check on IP's
* AbuseIPDB
* Cisco Talos Intelligence
* 
- Regarding the VirtualLab project - some resources will be:
	- VulnHub - https://www.vulnhub.com/
	- Test encryption using Wireshark
	- LAN Lab
	- See if you can sniff the packets and decrypt the hash blocks (or whatever cipher is being used by Viber say for example in a transmitted packet/message | concatenate all the packets sent to resemble the full message, gather them all, and then try brute fuck the shit out of it)
		- Perhaps also see if there are any differences in software versions (of say Viber etc) in different OS builds (as they're constructed differently - however the encryption algo's would still be the same)
		- MFA packets on a VPN connection, and a non-VPN routed connection - results? 
   - Look into alternatives for Protonmail and Lavapit
   - Password Storage
	- bcrypt
	- scrypt
	- Argon2
	- PBKDF2
	- Salts
- Find all references to PATH and change them to CWD (CurrentWorkingDirectory) where relevant
	- Perhaps decide whether to do this or not because sometimes path can be a reference to a pwd command (or the current working directory and so on)
- Scripting (in bash and zsh)
- Obsidian plugins - do some looking intoooo
- How does a VM running on a Type 2 hypervisor route network traffic? 
- Look into the various forms/methods of telemetry
- Go through all the TODO's and TAKEAWAY's from each class
- **Go through each main subject and the content covered in the notes and expand on them in respective sections of this vault**
- **Rationalise/rationalize/organise! each topic/content in this vault**
- READ THROUGH THE HTB WRITEUP's
	- Again, and then again
	- They are really informative and thorough
- Tidy up this Vault
	- Make folders for each of the main headings (ie 1.0, 2.0 etc)
		- This has been completed
	- Link the folder contents respectively to where they belong in other pages
	- Figure out how to do softlinks (or is it a hardlink?) to subsections on different pages in this Vault
	- Put a bloody space between paragraphs... lel (make it look cleaner)
- Test to see if the Vault is accessible on other Rigs (via OneDrive)
- Tidy up Brave Bookmarks and replicate them on other Browsers when complete (mainly the Learning folder created for this course and merge it into the main that is currently there)
- Adjust other browsers to disable Javascript by default on all websites
- Tidy up all URL's linked in each page to make sure they are following the Obisidian standard (wtf that is..)
- Review the 'website' with NoScript, uBlock and Brave
	- Check the URL's of the blocked ones
		- This has been completed, however, ongoing adjustments when using all three. Brave seems to have its own functionality (similar to that of both NoScript and uBlock) built into it which you can tweak. 
	- Be Bold, Be Brave.
		- This is ongoing.. wtf :3 
		- Configure Brave further, look into it
