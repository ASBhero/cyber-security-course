I found this kind of funny - but I thought I'd take a snippet of how many clones have been made of this Repo since it's creation a little  while ago.

I hope I've been of help in some sort of way by putting this set of information together, reader. Albeit it is for me - I'm happy to share. 
Pay it forward n wot not.
