##---------------------------------
- Covering learning techniques, methodologies, concepts, philosophies etc
- Put things into practice
- People have different learning styles
- Homework that is assigned doesn't have a deadline/due-date as such
	- Work at your own pace
	- More of a way for Kris to gauge the progression/knowledge-increase of students in the class
- Don't rely on walkthroughs/cheats/writeups in learning platforms like THM or HTB
	- Cheatsheet looks ups imo are fine - as they are resource articles from which you'll learn a bunch of stuff. That's how I like to learn as you do research at the same time
	- Just beware getting caught in a rabbit hole - straight up <3
- The fear of not knowing something
	- Leads to anxiety
	- Leads to the dark side
	- Leads to not wanting to ask questions......... 
- THM (TryHackMe)
	- Kris will be able to acquire tokens for us to use for 
	- With the use of the Unitec email address
		- Change the primary email to the Unitec one to begin with to use the free tokens that Kris may be able to acquire
		- Change it back to your primary mailbox when this course is complete and be merry
- System PATHs in different OSes
	- An environment variable on Unix, DOS, OS/2, and MS Windows, specifying a set of directories where executable programs are located. 
	- Each User Session has its own PATH settings
	- Windows: 
		C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps

Terms/Resources/RandomStuff:
- Symmetric - one key is used to both encrypt and decrypt plaintext
- Asymmetric - you have two different keys that are used (expand on this)

Python/Programming
- Control Flow - 
- Different kinds of Teams
	- Defensive Team
	- Red Teaming
	- SOC - Security Operations Centre
	- Compliance
- Debugging
	- The process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in the source code of any software. 
	- Programmers will start to study the code to determine why any errors have occurred
- Rubber Duck Debugging
	- You talk to an inanimate object and you describe what you're stuck on
	- The process of what you're currently stuck on into words, can be helpful and assist in finding the solution on whatever problem/issue you're working on
- System PATHs in different OSes
	- An environment variable on Unix, DOS, OS/2, and MS Windows, specifying a set of directories where executable programs are located. 
	- Each User Session has its own PATH settings
	- Windows: 
		In PowerShell:
			echo $env:path
	- Unix:
			echo $PATH
	
- Programming Topics:
	- Variables (in programming)
		- recap from programming courses (do a Google search if you get stuck and define this in Terminologies)
	- In the words of Kris (LUL):
		- Java - for those types who like to be precise about everything in their lives
		- Python - for laid back people
	- In the words of Randle (Matthew)
		- TypeScript (JavaScript with Syntax for Types)
		- When you're coding in a programming language (normally) you're typing in a high-level language
			- Which the language via its compiler, will translate to a lower-level machine type language for the computer system to process
		- VBA - Visual Basic for Applications
			- Used in Excel/Word/Office applications to create Macros etc
		- PowerShell 
		(The above is not verbatim but generally along the lines of what Randle said)
	- Compiler
		- A special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code, bytecode or another programming language
		- Computer games for example 
	- Interpreter
		- A computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program. (Wikipedia)
		- For when code needs to run on the fly and not need to be compiled (not good for computer games for example as they will need to be running of compiled code)
		- Kris's analogy
			- Like the United Nations you have reps from each country in the UN who talk about their topics/issues etc
				- They speak in their own language, and other reps/people won't be able to understand
				- Interpreters are there in real-time (with some delay, few seconds or whatever) translating what each speaker is saying for the given rep of that country
				- You don't lose precision, HOWEVER, you do lose performance (on system resources that are running the interpreter)
	- Control Flow 
	- Different kinds of Teams
		- Defensive Team
		- Red Teaming
		- SOC - Security Operations Centre
		- Compliance
	- Debugging

- Constant

OSINT
 - OSINT - Open-Source Intelligence
	- Being really good for searching stuff online
	- Have a look at ADSB below
	- Tracking people, tactics etc
- ADSB - Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast
	- in regards to FlightRadar24.com 
	- Each plane has a transponder
	- https://globe.adsbexchange.com/
	- https://www.flightradar24.com/
	- https://www.vesselfinder.com/
	- Satellite Trackers:
		- https://in-the-sky.org/satmap_worldmap.php
		- https://satellitemap.space/
- NZ is responsible for a lot of ocean
	- "Search: NZ Search and Rescue Region"
	- Have to look out for:
		- For sea-bed trawlers
		- Mayday calls
		- Pirates
		- Illegal fishing
		- Others, look em up if you want

- Department of Defense 
		- Launched a satellite for Defcon (end of July beginning of August)
		- So people can practice hacking into it
		- Because there are a lot of systems on satellites orbiting around space which are from a long time ago, ie the 1970s, that aren't running with the same technology (hardware, software etc) as what we have now
- Cube Satellites
	- Private companies (similar to Starlink) go up in lower-orbit and knowing the security that goes with that can help with the defensive side of things (or vice versa)
	- Kris' brother works in relation to these kinds of tech
- WIGLE:
	- https://wigle.net/
	- All the networks. Found by Everyone
	- Google cars when running around used to scan SSID's around any given area
		- Had a database wherein they didn't have it secured with ACLs
- Strava (fitness app)
	- They had a world map
	- https://www.strava.com/maps/global-heatmap (this is their heat map)
	- Routines and Habit generation from individuals
	- Afghanistan war
		- Whoever had Strava on their smart devices (usually the Westerners!) were allowing others to view their activity
- GPS (Global Positioning System)
	- Three satellites
		- Consumer Grade
			- Depending the signal strength on your phone can pick up your location with a 10m difference or triangulation area
		- Military Grade
			- Distance difference of millimetres
	- Geofencing
		- Creates a virtual geographical boundary that triggers a marketing action to a mobile device when a user enters or exits that boundary.
- Spoofing
- Shodan Search Engine (https://www.shodan.io/)
	- Crawling, IP lookups, searching, data streaming)
	- Shodan is the world's first search engine for Internet-connected devices. Discover how Internet intelligence can help you make better decisions.

	 - Security Tube (http://www.securitytube.net/)
	- Youtube Downloader (from GitHub get the previous link)
		- Useful for Conference Talks (ie DefCon) discussions/presentations
		- User the downloader to get these clips before they get taken down
	- Physical Security
		- ie lockpicking

- Kris: Tricks of the eye when focusing on a moving object, ie satellites, when on a clear night NZ sky, your eye will sometimes when focusing so hard, make it look like the object stutters briefly - but when looking at photographic recording the object was actually moving in a straight line (straight enough, just not distorted like your eyes made them out to be)
