- Telemetry
	- ie Google monitoring what you say in the background of your smart/portable device
	- Gate Analysis
		- Analysis of how someone walks
---
PROGRAMMING
- Covering Programming today woo
	- Python - good way to go
		- Replit is a good ground for this as they have the runtime environment going on the fly
		- 
- Pseudocode
	- A notation resembling a simplified programming language, used in program design.
	- ALWAYS WRITE UP A PSEUDOCODE - it actually does help.
- LLM - Large Language Models
- CoPilot
	- You can change parameters
		- ie you type in "good" possible suggestions that can come up are morning, night, day etc
- Comments
	  - usually identified by symbols like # for example, or ##, or // (tells the computer to ignore whatever is in the text, it is there "for humans" .. lol)
	- Python: #
	- C, C#, Javascript: //
	- ALWAYS COMMENT - for the sake of your own sanity and also others (but mainly for yourself - and also get into good habits when commenting - don't be a slack derpaderp.)
	- Comment will state the intent of what the following block of code will be
	- 
- Languages
	- Python
		- #! - special comment
			- At the start of code
			- Also called hashbang, or shebang
			- If you run ! on a Unix shell > you can do a series of different things
			- ie #!/usr/bin/env python3 will take python3 from the env PATH as stated
			- 
	- C
	- C#
	- Java
	- Javascript
		- node.js
	- Scheme
	- LISP
	- JScript
	- Actionscript
	-

Terms / Resources:
- Telemetry:
	- Telemetry is **the automatic recording and transmission of data from remote or inaccessible sources to an IT system in a different location for monitoring and analysis**. (Stackify.com)
- Gatekeeping
- Notruescotsman 
	- If you don't have this qualification ra ra you're not a real cybersec engineer bla bla 
		- BS!
- https://www.geonet.org.nz/earthquake - shows earthquakes, their intensity's etc
- ECMAscript
	- ECMAScript (/ˈɛkməskrɪpt/; ES) is **a standard for scripting languages, including JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript**. It is best known as a JavaScript standard intended to ensure the interoperability of web pages across different web browsers
- YoutubeDownloadPlus - https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp >> have a look
- DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act)
	- DMCA takedowns are when content is removed due to copyright violations
- AES encryption - Advanced Encryption Standard
- Padding Size - when there is a padding size > 
- Remember that hash is one-way
- Encryption however, is a way wherein it can be reversed (if needs be, with brute force methodology say)
- Decrypt is the reversal of encryption
- Plaintext - plain form of any kind of data, can be an image, video/movie, anything that doesn't have any encryption on it
	- Plaintext (PT) > (key symbol or K) Encryption > CipherText (CT) 
- Symmetric Key Encryption 
	- your key locks and unlocks, encrypts and decrypts text
- Asymmetric Key Encryption
	- Uses two keys
		- Public key (what you share with everyone else, this can lock something)
		- Private key (what the encryptor keeps themselves, does not share this with anyone else)
		- Port 443 uses this
- PGP - Pretty Good Privacy
- Key Server
- 
- Cyberchef (on Github) - https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/
	- A Web App for encryption, encoding, compression and data analysis. 
- Quantum Computing!!
	- qbits
- Entropy
	- Entropy, in the context of cryptography, is **related to random number generation, and more precisely, it refers to the “amount of unpredictable randomness**” in a physical system. We call an entropy source the physical system that produces random signals. (Quside)
	- "not much entropy in that number generation"
- 0-Day (or zero-day) vulnerability
	- Special type of bug where people have not had any time to prepare any defense for
	- - A zero-day is a vulnerability in software or hardware that is typically unknown to the vendor and for which no patch or other fix is available. The vendor has zero days to prepare a patch as the vulnerability has already been described or exploited. (Wikipedia)

ToDo:
- Finish off 20240626 and 27th's todo's
- Do today's Todo's lol
- Look into the background of Skype
		- Monitoring
- Look into the various forms/methods of telemetry
- Look at the different Copilots (MS, Github etc)
- Look up Brendon Eich, working for Netscape back in the day, early 90s, creating a web-browser, suspecting it would've been Navigator
	- He used a language called "scheme" - which is a dialect from the LISP language
- Expand on the various programming languages, their history, their differences, where they are mainly/largely used
	- Also expand the list with other languages too
- Github > Burger menu > Explore > Trending > Language (Python for example) >> have a look around
- YoutubeDownloadPlus - https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp >> have a look
	- Check out the MS YoutubeDownload issue that happened
- Get back to training with Python
	- https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/tree/master/yt_dlp --> check it out
