- How the Internet works (Networking side of things)
- Windows stuff

- Windows Powertoys
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/
	- Most of the tools built with C#
	- hosts file editor
	- Redirects DNS calls to an IP address
	- The /etc/hosts file **contains the Internet Protocol (IP) host names and addresses for the local host and other hosts in the Internet network**. This file is used to resolve a name into an address (that is, to translate a host name into its Internet address). - taken from IBM.com
	- A text file in a TCP/IP network that _specifies the IP addresses of computer names and domain names_. It is used to convert a request by name to a numeric IP (taken from pcmag.com)
	- AdBlocking software tends to work in a similar fashion
		- Keeps a list of tracking website > and redirects any traffic to a malicious website to your own computer (meaning that there isn't any traffic coming in from the bogus site)
		- These lists can get quite large and AdBlockers ...(find out more)
	- These hosts file live in both environments, Windows and Unix-based systems
- DOXING
	- Documents (back in the day)
	- PII (personally identifiable information)
	- Doxing is when someone gets PII and leaks it online
	- 
Threat Modelling
- Undersea Cabelling
	- Fishing trawlers
	- Sharks
		- Having electromagnetic sensors on the tip of their noses - there have been cases of them biting undersea cables
	- Underwater Volcanos, Geysers (Michelle)
	- Tectonic plate movement (earthquakes)
	- Other countries tapping into cables
		- splices the fibre cable, people using it will notice a flicker in service, and then start redirecting the traffic elsewhere (essentially sniffing)

- DNS Route Servers
  https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/
	- https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers
	- https://root-servers.org/
	- Operator Groups
		- https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/
		  Check out the discussion topics that take place here
		- NZNOG.og
			- og - operators group
	- A Servers 
		- A collection of top-level domains (TLD)
			- What comes at the very end of a domain name 
			- GTLD - generic .com .net .org and so on
			- CCTLD - Country Code TLDs - .nz .au .se . us .tk .tw .to .ws etc
	- F Servers
		  - Internet Systems Consortium
		  - The most important root servers
	- If your computer doesn't have a DNS record handy locally, it will then ask your gateway/router > which will then ask the Network Service Provider in most cases (they have their own DNS servers which can resolve addresses or speak with other DNS servers that can resolve the name and get back to you in the end through all the routes that take place)
	- Root Servers
	- Verisign are the ones who manage the .com TLD space
	- ICANN are the authority of domain names
		- Verisign back in 2003 > when typing an website domain name used to give an error > Verisign tried to redirect users to a website to give them the opportunity to purchase the domain name
			- Domain squatter > "hey purchase this domain name" so on
			- They yoink domain names and resell them to the entity that originally had it for a higher price - cheers mayte
	- DNC - Domain Name Commission 
		- Responsible for all the local domain names that are sold
		- ie searching for DNC NZ Registrars (https://dnc.org.nz/tools-and-services/find-a-nz-provider/nz-authorised-registrars/)
		- Anonymization

	- Also check out sharks, because sharks. And their noses biting undersea cables
- Bermuda Triangle lels - Josh
	- As radio has become more advanced, a lot of the dangers don't seem no prominent anymore
	- Lemmino did a whole documentary on it - I recommend watching it (Kazuki) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgMcqNnqatw)

		  Check out the discussion topics that take place here
- Touch on DNS again (https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/ and others)
	- Look into DNS Anonymization
- Look into kryptos sculpturing
	- https://www.cia.gov/legacy/headquarters/kryptos-sculpture
	- From Jason
- DNS Crypt -  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSCrypt#:~:text=Anonymized%20DNSCrypt,-Anonymized%20DNSCrypt%20is&text=Instead%20of%20directly%20responding%20to,through%20Tor%20and%20SOCKS%20proxies.
	- look into
