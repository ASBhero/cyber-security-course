- DNSCrypt
	- Network protocol that authenticates and encrypts Domain Name System (DNS) traffic between the User's computer and recursive name servers. DNSCrypt wraps unmodified DNS traffic between a client and a DNS resolver in a cryptographic construction, preventing eavesdropping and forgery by a main-in-the-middle attack.
