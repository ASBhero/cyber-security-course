- Go through all the TODO's and TAKEAWAY's from each class
- Tidy up this Vault
	- Make folders for each of the main headings (ie 1.0, 2.0 etc)
	- Link the folder contents respectively to where they belong in other pages
	- Put a bloody space between paragraphs... lel (make it look cleaner)
- Test to see if the Vault is accessible on other Rigs (via OneDrive)
- Tidy up Brave Bookmarks and replicate them on other Browsers when complete (mainly the Learning folder created for this course and merge it into the main that is currently there)
- Perhaps start sharing this Obsidian Vault (as a .md file?) on GitHub (private preferably)
- Tidy up all URL's linked in each page to make sure they are following the Obisidian standard (wtf that is..)
