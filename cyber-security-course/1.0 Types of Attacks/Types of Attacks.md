(the above was taken from crowdstrike.com as the 12 most common types of attacks today June 2024)

- Fork Bomb
	- Also known as a Rabbit Virus)
	- Self-replicating child processes consume system resources, blocking legitimate programs from running and preventing the creation of new processes. During an attack, keyboard inputs (log out attempts for example) are ignored, essentially locking the system
- Zip Bomb
	- Also known as Decompression Bomb or Zip of Death (ZOD)
	- A malicious archive file designed to crash or render useless the program or system reading it. Often employed to disable antivirus software, in order to create an opening for more traditional malware.
	- Instead of hijacking the program's operation, creates an archive that requires an excessive amount of time, disk space or memory to unpack. 
	- Most modern AV utilities can detect a ZIP Bomb before unpacking it. 
	- The “42. zip” is one of the largest and best-known zip bombs. When unopened, it appears to hold only 42 kilobytes of data. However, after decompressing, the file can expand to 4.5 petabytes (the equivalent of 4,500 terabytes). (taken from us.norton.com)
- XML Bomb
	- A form of DOS/DDOS attack where a small piece of code is sent to overwhelm the program that parses XML files and crash the server. 
	- When an XML parser tries to process the message, nested data entities inside of it start growing exponentially and crash the server. 
	- A BILLION Laughs (lol)
- Growth Hacking
