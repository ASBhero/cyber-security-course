- Variables (in programming)
	- recap from programming courses (do a Google search if you get stuck and define this in Terminologies)
	- In the words of Kris (LUL):
		- Java - for those types who like to be precise about everything in their lives
		- Python - for laid back people
	- In the words of Randle (Matthew)
		- TypeScript (JavaScript with Syntax for Types)
		- When you're coding in a programming language (normally) you're typing in a high-level language
			- Which the language via its compiler, will translate to a lower-level machine type language for the computer system to process
		- VBA - Visual Basic for Applications
			- Used in Excel/Word/Office applications to create Macros etc
		- PowerShell 
		(The above is not verbatim but generally along the lines of what Randle said)
	- Compiler
		- A special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code, bytecode or another programming language 
	- Interpreter
		- A computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program. (Wikipedia)
		- Kris's analogy
			- Like the United Nations you have reps from each country in the UN who talk about their topics/issues etc
				- They speak in their own language, and other reps/people won't be able to understand
				- Interpreters are there in real-time (with some delay, few seconds or whatever) translating what each speaker is saying for the given rep of that country
				- You don't lose precision, HOWEVER, you do lose performance.
