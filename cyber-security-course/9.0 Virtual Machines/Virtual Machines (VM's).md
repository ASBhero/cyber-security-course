Hypervisor
- Software that runs and manages one or more virtual machines
- Two basic types:
	- Type1
		- Minimal and interfaces directly with system hardware
	- Type 2
		- Software that runs on top of an operating system
	- Essentially meaning that Type1 Hypervisors will have better performance as there isn't a middle-man as such operating between the VM's and the hardware that it will generally speak with
- Variations:
	- Hyper-V
	- VMware
	- VirtualBox
	- Qemu
